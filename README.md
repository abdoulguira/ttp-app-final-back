# ttp-app-final-back

# Keep in mind that the back end is everything the user can't interact with. 

# we will be providing data to the users base on what they request

# we will also allow them to sign up and sign in so they can be able to have access and use the MovieWorld App !!!!

# we will be creating api's with different end points like get,post,delete,and put or update.

# each end point will have an api link. for example /getData/id and the id will be the id on our table located in our database

# Also we will have to host our api's link to heroku so we can make them available online for the frontend develolers

# by the way, I believe we all agreed to create an app called MovieWorld.

# every new User will need to signUp to become a MovieWorld user.

# Users will need to sign in to have access to their account

# their authentications will checked on the database to see if they are active user

# we will prompt any new user who doesn't have an account yet.

# The movieworl app will have a search button that will allow users to search for available movies on our movie api.

# 5 key words will be allow for users to Enter. Like enter "Horror, comedy, drama, romance and thriller"

# MovieWorl will display available movies base on the user choice.

# ones available movies are promted to the user, they can be clicked and we will link the movie to a youtube movie.

# We can also think about adding a rollover that will show the description of the movie.

# I guess we would have to create our own api that will host gifs or pictures.
